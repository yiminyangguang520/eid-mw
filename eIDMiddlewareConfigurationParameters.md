## Locations ##
There are 2 locations for the parameters:
  * A system-wide location: This is the same for all users on the system.
  * A user-specific location: Each user can have specific value for his parameters in this location.
The absolute location depends on the platform:
  * For Windows, the parameters are in the registry.
    * System-wide: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BEID`
    * User-specific : `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\BEID`
  * For Mac, the parameters are in configuration files.
    * System-wide : `/usr/local/etc/beid.conf`
    * User-specific : `~/Library/Preferences/beid.conf`
  * For Linux, the parameters are also in configuration files.
    * System-wide : `/usr/local/etc/beid.conf`
    * User-specific : `~/.config/beid.conf`

The parameters are grouped by category. In the Windows registry, each category is a new sub-key. While in Mac/Linux configuration files, each category is a new section (e.g. `[general]`)
## Remarks ##
  * The category and parameter name are always in lower case.
  * There are 2 different types of parameters: "String" and "Number". This type mostly matters for the type of registry value:
    * String: REG\_SZ value
    * Number: DWORD value

## Searching rules ##
The way the middleware get the value of a parameter is always the same.
  1. First, it looks in the user-specific location, if the parameter is defined there, it takes this value.
  1. Else it looks in the system-wide location, and if it’s defined, it takes this value.
  1. Else it uses the (hardcoded) default value.
